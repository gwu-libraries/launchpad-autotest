This repository contains casperjs scripts used to test the GW Libraries' Launchpad web application. In addition to the .js files, a configuration file and a few Shell scripts are provided to call the scripts.

1. Install phantomjs
   Get version 1.9

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential chrpath git-core libssl-dev libfontconfig1-dev
git clone git://github.com/ariya/phantomjs.git
cd phantomjs
git checkout 1.9
./build.sh

- - - - build will take a few minutes - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

2. Identify phantomjs

   a) After the build completes, run command 
      This command may locate it. 
 
      $which phantomjs

      if not, find where phantom_v1.9/phantomjs/bin/phantomjs is located.

   b) Edit your .profile file, add the path to phantomjs
      eg.,
	
      PATH=$PATH:/home/cummings/projects/phantom/phantom_v1.9/phantomjs/bin

      Save changes to .profile

   c) exit
      logon again


3. Install casperjs

   Install casperjs by following the instructions posted here:

   http://http://docs.casperjs.org/en/latest/installation.html#installing-from-git

4. Download the files to your local repository

   Verify you have files config.js, issue.sh, errorlists.sh, and some files with
   the extension .js named after an issue number (eg., 248.js, 385.js)

5. Edit the file named config.js 

   a) Set the URL prefix to the appropriate server.
   b) Save changes to config.js 

6. Run a test using the shell script issue.sh
   The script requires the name of a script file, such as 248.sh

   	$sh issue.sh 248

	Test results should appear on screen
	A log file of test results will be named log-NNN.xml

.. To run multiple tests use one of the shell scripts that call multiple
   issues (eg. sh m14-001.sh) or create your own script to do that.

.. Run the script errorslist.sh to identify any xml file that contains errors.
   Optionally, put the xml log files somewhere where they may be parsed and or displayed.

	$sh errorslist.sh


.. To create new scripts, you may want to begin by making a copy of the template.txt file

.. Documentation on the casperjs test suite API is available at
